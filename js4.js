// Function

// function is a block of code that fullfill a specifuc  task
// A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that
// performs a task or calculates a value. However, for a procedure to qualify as a function


// let number=10;
// let name='gaurav'

//function square(number, name1) {return name1 + "'s square is: " + number * number;}

//console.log(square(2, 'Gaurav'));


// In JavaScript, hoisting is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their
// containing scope during the compilation phase, although their assignments remain in place.


console.log(a); // Output: ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
console.log(b); // Output: undefined

console.log(c); // Output: ReferenceError: Cannot access 'c' before initialization

let a = 123;
var b = 'gaurav';
const c = 12.5;


foo(); 

function foo() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
